rtlib-gui
=========

A GUI for interacting with traces and running some simulaitions in rtlib.


Compiling
---------

First, compile metasim 2 and rtlib 2 and install qt5 library and headers.

You should then be able to run:

    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

The executable will be placed in build/rtlib-gui (btw, your shell will be also
moved to build)
